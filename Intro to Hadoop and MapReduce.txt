Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce

Big Data
========

Huge data requires storage and processing solutions.

What is Big Data?
Data too big to be stored and processed on a single machine.

Challenges with Big Data:
a. Data is created fast.
b. Data from different sources in various formats.

3Vs in Big Data:
a. Volume
b. Variety
c. Velocity

Data can be stored in raw format in Hadoop unlike traditional storage solutions.

Apache Hadoop: Big data storage and processing solution.

Hadoop:
Store in HDFS
Process with MapReduce

Big data is broken down into blocks of data and distributed in a cluster.
Processing is done in distributed mode.

Hadoop Ecosystem:
1. HDFS
2. MapReduce
3. Hive: Turn SQL into MapReduce which runs on cluter to fetch data from HDFS.
4. Pig: Use scripting language, rather than MapReduce
5. Impala: Directly use SQL to query data present in HDFS.
6. Sqoop: Import/Export data from HDFS and relational databases.
7. Flume: Ingest data as it generated by external systems and put it in cluster.
8. HBase: Real time database build on top of HDFS.
9. Hue: Graphical frontend to the cluster.
10. Oozie: Workflow management tool.
11. Mahout: Machine Learning library

CDH is open source solution to manage Hadoop Ecosystem.
